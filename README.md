QUTIP B.S. final Project

ABSTRACT: The aim of this thesis is to explore quantum trajectory theory and how it relates to the
conventional methods of studying open quantum systems, namely the Lindblad master
equation. Quantum trajectories lead to stochastic evolution of systems consisting of
discontinuous jumps. Quantum trajectories make use of state vectors rather than density matrices, making them more computationally efficient at simulating open quantum
systems than master equation solvers. The thesis will compute these trajectories for a
particular scheme of qubit systems for two types of interactions: CNOT and SWAP.

NOTE: All code is commented, and is further clarified in the thesis. The code and accompanying thesis is my work as a bachelor's student at the Indian Institute of Science, this is not an official representation of the Institute or any persons associated with the same. It is simply a public record of what I have done.
